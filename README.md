# MQG app
Mathematics Questionnaires Generator - Azrieli College of Engineering 2017 Graduation project.
# About
MQG is a web app, allowing teachers to write questionnaires for students to solve. Questions in questionnaires are mathematical. The question types are given. In the app we provide the teachers with templates - corresponding with the given question types - filling these templates finally generates the desired question.
The app also provides basic user management.
# Prototype
For the prototype we implemented a 'multiple choice' question type. We are using MathJax and function-plot to allow the writer to be more expressive.
# Deployment
At this stage the Prototype is deployed using Azure.
